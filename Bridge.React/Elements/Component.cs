			// For each derived class we need to create React component class, this is like a template for the form of the component - individual instances will be created by
			// taking this template and using React.createElement to prepare a new element with the specified props. There should only be one React component class per unique
			// class but multiple React elements - one per instance of the class. The template is prepared by taking the first instance of any component class and ensuring
			// promoting all functions from the class prototype (which is where they will be defined for Bridge classes) since React's internal logic uses hasOwnProperty when
			// looking for key functions such as "render". Most functions can be promoted in a simple manner but there are some exceptions - "constructor" must be ignored
			// (otherwise React will raise a warning "You are attempting to define `constructor` on your component more than once" and "setState") and any of the component
			// lifecycle methods that involves props or state access need special handling. This is because React presumes that all props and state objects will be simple
			// object literals and they get picked apart during processing - so if a Bridge class is used for the props object that has a "name" property with "getName" and
			// "setName" functions on the prototype then React will maintain the "name" value but lose the getter and setter. The way around this is to stash the props object
			// in a simple wrapper with a "value" property which React will allow through its internals since it doesn't recursively meddle with the data - this "value" may be
			// a Bridge class (or an ObjectLiteral, it doesn't matter). The only complications around this approach are that anywhere that props are accessed, a redirection is
			// required - so that the component class gets the "value" reference. This counts not only for components' "this.props" access but also for functions such as
			// "componentWillReceiveProps" since the C# code will expect the "nextProps" value to be of type TProps and not a wrapper with a "value" property of type TProps.
			// The same logic goes for the state reference. Note that this effectively means that state is completely replaced when the "SetState" function is called, since the
			// single "value" reference is over-written. This makes the "SetState" implementation here closer to "replaceState" in React, but I didn't name it "ReplaceState"
			// instead of "SetState" since the React 0.14 docs say that that function may be removed in the future. However, "SetState" replacing the entire state reference,
			// rather than merging it with whatever data is already there is - I think - the least surprising approach when considered in terms of C#; it makes more sense to
			// replace the current data with the new reference, rather than merge - merging is not a common action in C#, though it is in JavaScript (eg. merging default
			// "options" with any explicit settings in many JavaScript APIs).
			// - To ensure that a single "template" (ie. React component) is created per unique class, a static "_reactComponentClass" reference is maintained. When this is
			//   null, for the first instantiation of any particular component class, it will be populated and then re-used for any further component instances. To avoid
			//   relying upon the undocumented internal Bridge semantics around static variables, a local "reactComponentClass" is set to the static reference in C# code,
			//   this is then configured in JavaScript if found to be null (and then the static reference is updated again in C# after the JavaScript code has run, ensuring
			//   that the static property is updated without the code here having to worry about how Bridge deals with statics under the hood)
