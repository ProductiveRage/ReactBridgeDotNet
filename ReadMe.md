# React bindings for Bridge.net

This is a sample project that demonstrate how to write [Bridge.net](http://bridge.net/) code that works with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

Full details of the code may be found in my blog post [React (and Flux) with Bridge.net](http://www.productiverage.com/react-and-flux-with-bridgenet).

**Update (6th November 2015):** This has been updated to work with React 0.14 and has introduced a new StatelessComponent class and a way to call SetState on the Component class. The blog post linked above is now out of date - but a new one is coming soon!
