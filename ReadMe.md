# React bindings for Bridge.net

This is a sample project that demonstrate how to write [Bridge.net](http://bridge.net/) code that works with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

Full details of the code may be found in my blog post [React (and Flux) with Bridge.net](http://www.productiverage.com/react-and-flux-with-bridgenet).

**Update (6th November 2015):** This has been updated to work with React 0.14 and has introduced a new StatelessComponent class and a way to call SetState on the Component class. The blog post linked above is now out of date - but a new one is coming soon!

**Update (10th December 2015):** I've moved the main bindings into a separate repo ([github.com/ProductiveRage/Bridge.React](https://github.com/ProductiveRage/Bridge.React)) that may be installed through NuGet ("Bridge.React"). At some point I will update this example solution to pull in the bindings from NuGet to avoid the code duplication of having older binding code here. More information may be found at [React (and Flux) with Bridge.net - Redux](http://www.productiverage.com/react-and-flux-with-bridgenet-redux).

**Update (18th February 2016):** I've updated this project so that it's now a simple example of how to use the React bindings available in the [Bridge.React NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bridge.React) ([source on GitHub](https://github.com/ProductiveRage/Bridge.React)).
